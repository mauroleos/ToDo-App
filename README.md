# ToDo-app
This is my second application where I learned how to leverage local storage using Javascript to store user inputs locally into the browser. This application was written entirely in pure Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

# Summary
While building this application I focused on creating dynamic elements and append them to the DOM. The application allows users to add items to the list, mark items as complete, and delete completed items form the list. I built this application using only JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This application was special to me because I learned how to leverage local storage using Javascript to store user inputs locally into the browser. I really enjoyed working on this application!
